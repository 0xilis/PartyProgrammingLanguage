  /*
   Hello! These are multi-line Party comments.
   You can use them for clarity on your codebase.
   They don't affect the end speed of your program,
   as they aren't included in the compiled binary,
   so you don't need to worry about including too many.
   At least, not speed-wise.
   
   If you're wondering why I did [] for the println
   Instead of (), it's because you cannot use
   () in a string currently in Party. You also
   cannot include " in the middle of a string.
   Be aware however that this likely will change soon
   if I ever decide to flush Party out more.

   Oh, and I should mention, you can also do
   */
